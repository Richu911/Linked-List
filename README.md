# Linked List

## Overview
This is a C++ implementation of a singly linked list data structure. The linked list is a dynamic collection of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.

## Features
* Insertion and deletion of nodes at the beginning, end, and at specific positions in the list
* Searching for nodes by value
* Traversal of the list in forward direction
* Reversing the list
* Finding the length of the list
* Finding the Kth node from the end

## Usage
To use the linked list, simply include the `richu_LinkedList.h` header file in your C++ program and create an instance of the `LinkedList` class.
